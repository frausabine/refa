The painting and miniature collection of the publishing couple Franz and Frieda von Lipperheide, which had previously been deposited, was examined within the framework of the project for necessary conservation interventions, stabilized and treated for conservation in individual cases, dusted and digitized. The large-format paintings were captured with a high-performance scanner from the company Kruse. A few works that could not be transported were photographed in the depot on the grid wall. Prints and drawings were digitized with high resolutions in .tiff format.
